<h1 class="article-title">The Cloud Is Just Someone Else's Computer</h1>

When we started Discourse in 2013, Our server requirements were high:

<ul>

  <li>1GB RAM</li>

  <li>modern, fast dual-core CPU</li>

  <li>speedy solid state drive with 20+ GB</li>

</ul>

The cloud got cheaper, and faster. Not really a surprise, since the price of hardware trends to zero over time. But it's still the cloud, and that means it isn't exactly cheap. It is, after all, someone else's computer that you pay for the privilege of renting.

 But wait … what if you could put your own computer "in the cloud"?

Wouldn't that be the best of both worlds? Reliable connectivity, plus an excellent low monthly price for high-speed hardware? If this sounds crazy, it shouldn't – Mac users have been doing this for years.

I originally wrote about the scooter computers we added to our Discourse infrastructure in 2016, plus my own colocation experiment that ran concurrently.

the last three years of both experiments, I've concluded that these little boxes are plenty reliable, with one role-specific caveat that I'll explain in the comments. I remain an unabashed fan of mini-PC colocation. I like it so much that I put together a new 2019 iteration:

  

<table>

 <tr>

  <th>2017 - $670</th>

  <th>2019 - $820</th>

 </tr>

 <tr>

  <td>i7 - 7500u</td>

  <td>i7 - 8750h</td>

 </tr>

 <tr>

  <td>2.7-3.5 GHz, 2c /4t</td>

  <td>2.2-4.1 GHz, 6c /12t</td>

 </tr>

 <tr>

  <td>16GB DDR3 RAM</td>

  <td>32GB DDR4 RAM</td>

 </tr>

 <tr>

  <td>500GB SATA SSD</td>

  <td>500GB NVMe SSD</td>

 </tr>

</table>

I vetted each box via my recommended burn-in and stability testing and they all passed with flying

colors, though I did have to RMA one set of body RAM sticks in the process. The benchmarks tell the story, as compared to the average Digital Ocean droplet:

  

Pre-core performance

  

<code>sysbench cpu --cpu-max-prime=20000 run</code>

<table>

 <tr>

  <td>DO Droplet</td>

  <td>2,988</td>

 </tr>

 <tr>

  <td>2017 Mini-PC</td>

  <td>4,800</td>

 </tr>

 <tr>

  <td>2019 Mini-PC</td>

  <td>5,671</td>

 </tr>

</table>

  

Multi-core performance

  

<code>sysbench cpu --cpu-max-prime=4¢8060@ --nuUmM-threads=8 run</code>

<table>

<tr>

<td>DO Droplet</td>

<td>2,200</td>

</tr>

 <tr>

<td>2017 Mini-PC</td>

<td>5,588</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>2019 Mini-PC</td>

<td>14,604</td>

</tr>

</table>

If you'd also like to embark upon this project, you can get

 the same Partaker B18 box I did for $490 from Amazon, or $460 direct from China via AliExpress.

 Add memory and drive to taste, build it up, then check outendoffice.com

 I can enthusiastically recommend colocation or the colocation provider of your choice.
